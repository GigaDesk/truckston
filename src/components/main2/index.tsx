            description="How delicate the cargo being translocated is will dictate packaging and handling. While some items like glass and granite tops might need specialised transportation, costs can be very high. There are however smarter ways of securing such items and limiting handling (loading and offloading) to reduce risks of damage and costs. It is worth talking to item dealers and your transporter to explore best ways of securing such items. This has been very helpful to us and various clients with glass panels, gypsum boards and granite stones amongst others. We therefore have expertise in handling these.

For road transport, the conditions of the road network between the collection and delivery points is an important consideration. Notably, a bad (also narrow) road might not permit delivery to the final site. Therefore, together with your transporter, deliberate on means of delivery that avoids damages and delays. In addition, honestly inform your transporter of the final destination and status of local road networks. Otherwise, this could result into delays, increased transportation cost and damage both of good on transportation and the vehicle. This will consequently affect other clients, if the load is consolidated.

Notably, exceeding Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) approved carriers tonnage and/or load sizes requires specific permits whose costs might be met by the client. In addition, costs can be adjusted based on nature of goods on transport e.g. fragile items such as glass panel and gypsum boards might prevent addition of other items, consequently occupying large space resulting into adjusted charges. This should not be a hinderance for valuable items, since lower charges might result in addition of more goods that can damage your fragile goods. This risk more often is too costly."
